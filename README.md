# vocabulary.com.js
Lightweight Javascript exploit to automatically generate points in vocabulary.com 

## NOTE: NO LONGER WORKING

I emailed this code to the developers of vocabulary.com a while ago and they have finally patched this. The answers now validate server-side as opposed to client-side. 

## How to use

Go to vocabulary.com and log in. Paste the contents of `vocabulary.com.js` into the console and hit enter. As long as the window is open in the background it will continuously generate points.
